### An command-line application designed to insert, delete, and retain customer and drinks data, as well as generate an order of drinks.

The first of my two Generation projects. This involved creating a command-line application which would allow the insertion, deletion, and persistence of drinks and customer data, as well as setting drinks preferences to any uploaded customers, and generating a round of drinks which prints a receipt.

Extensive python programming was used to create the app. Some unit tests were carried out to ensure the code worked as intended. A MySQL database, using Adminer as the container, was used to house the data the app generated.
