### A few games that I made during the first Python course I completed via *Udemy*. 

The first game was Tic-Tac-Toe, made using functional programming in Python. Click **[here](https://github.com/taishan-143/Tic-Tac-Toe)** to view the repository.

The second game was Blackjack, made using a combination of Functional, Object-Oriented Programming, and Errors and Exceptions handling. Click **[here](https://github.com/taishan-143/BlackJack)** to view the repository.
