I'm a recent graduate from the Generation UK & Ireland **Junior Data Engineering Programme** with a educational background in *Aerospace Engineering*. I'm a meticulous individual who is continuously stiving to learn new technology and better understand it's use and potential in industry, and in the world. 

I graduated from the University of Manchester with a 2:1 in Aerospace Engineering in 2018. Since then, I have worked in hospitality, saved money to go travelling, taught myself the fundamentals of Python programming language, then became enrolled on the Generation **Junior Data Engineering Programme**. This intense 12-week programme covered a wide range of technical and professional skills including;

* Python - from conditionals and loops, to Functional and Object-Oriented Programming
* Unit Testing

On this course I completed two projects. 
The first involved building a command line application, designed to insert, remove, and persist drinks and customer information, as well as create a round of drinks for specified people and print a recipt. 
The second was a group project, where we were given a task from a company who own franchises of cafes, ivolving the conversion and upload of their data to a cloud based system, and then carrying out data visualisations to identify trends in their data to help the business better understand their customers.

In my spare time, I form part of a DJ collective called ***Good Custard***. We mix a variety of Disco, House, Electro, Acid, and Funky music, as well as making some of our own music and publishing it on our Soundcloud page. I'm also involved in a Product Deisgn project with a close friend, where we are iteratively designing a beard trimming stencil to be niche, universal, and provide an accurate cut on both sides of the face.
