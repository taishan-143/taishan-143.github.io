I'm a recent graduate from the Generation UK & Ireland **Junior Data Engineering Programme** with a educational background in *Aerospace Engineering*. 

I graduated from the University of Manchester with a 2:1 in Aerospace Engineering in 2018. Since then, I have worked in hospitality, saved money to go travelling, taught myself the fundamentals of Python programming language, then became enrolled on the Generation **Junior Data Engineering Programme**. This intense 12-week programme covered a wide range of technical and professional skills including;

* Python - from conditionals and loops, to Functional and Object-Oriented Programming
* Unit Testing
* Source Control using Git
* SQL - MySQL Database Management
* Containerisation with Docker
* AWS - S3, EC2, Lambda, Redshift, CloudWatch, CodePipeline, SQS, Quicksight 
* ETL 
* Agile/Scrum Methodologies
* Behavioural Mindsets: - Growth Mindset, Persistence, Proactiveness, Communication, Professionalism, Future Orientation, Orientation to Detail, Personal Responsibility, Time Management

On this course I completed two projects. The first involved building a command line application, designed to insert, remove, and persist drinks and customer information, as well as create a round of drinks for specified people, and print a recipt. A local *MySQL database*, using Adminer, was used to hold all the data the app had generated.

The second was a group project, where we were given a task from a company who own franchises of cafes, ivolving the conversion and upload of their data to a cloud based system, and then carrying out data visualisations to identify trends in their data to help the business better understand their customers. Here we used a lot of Amazon's Web Services to *Extract*, *Transform*, and then *Load* the data into a data warehouse, to then carry out visualsations on that data. We worked in a *Scrum* team for this project, completing sprints and holding sprint reviews and retrospectives at the end of each.
