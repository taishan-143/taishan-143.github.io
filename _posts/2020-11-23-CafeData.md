### A cloud-based system designed to extract, transform, and load cafe data into a data warehouse, which will then be extracted for data visualisation to identify trends in cafe franchises. 

The final Generation project was a group effort involving the creation of a serverless pipeline, which extracts data from a CSV file, Transforms the data to then be uploaded to a database. This data is then used to conduct data visualisation allowing cafe franchises to identify trends in their business and thus, better understand their customers.

AWS was used heavily within this project, namely: S3, EC2, Lambda, Redshift, CodePipeline, Cloudwatch, SQS, and Quicksight; as well as Python and YAML to build the pipeline and carry out unit tests; and SQL to query data into and out of our database and carry out visualisations on Quicksight.

Raw data was uploaded to the cloud, in CSV format, using an S3 bucket. The Lambda sevice was used for the extract, tansform and load stages. 

The extract lambda extracted the data from S3, using a boto3 connection, and sent the data as a message, via SQS, to our transform lambda. 

The transform lambda cleaned and reshaped the data into a suitable format for our designed database schema. This data was also sent as an SQS message to our load lambda.

The load lambda established a connection to our Redshift database and inserted the data into the tables of the database.

Dead Letter Queues (DLQ's) were made in the event that a message may fail to send, allowing for easier debugging, via Cloudwatch, and minimal pipeline execution. Once inserted into the database, Quicksight was used to carry out data visualisations.
